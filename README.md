Have you ever wondered what happens with your garbage in real life? Stuff just doesn't "despawn" out of existance, this mod adds that **_painful_** experience in to Minecraft!

(Video here soon)

Items on ground are now indestructible and will never despawn!
- TNT? Nope!
- Anvils? This was patched in 1.20
- Lava? It turns into ash!
- Cacti? **_I'll let you discover that one ;)_**

You will be wondering: "How can I get rid of my garbage then?"
I'm glad you asked!
1. Craft a BiomassProcessor.
2. Use any vegetal items to create Eco-Friendly Plastic!
3. Use the plastic to create a Garbage Bag and a Trash Can.
4. Put your items inside the Bag and the Bag inside the Can.
5. After a while a Garbage Truck will appear and take the garbage with it!



HELP! I accidentally threw an important item!

First of: How even?

If you want to get it back search for a "Garbage Dump" biome, there small piles of garbage will appear with Suspicious Garbage Blocks, use a Brush to extract items from them, you'll get at random any of the stacks you've ever thrown away.


Additional Info:
- A bag can support up to 128 items no matter the stack size, but can only be carried on your main hand or it will fall to the ground. You also cannot get the items back unless you break it.
- A trash can can only have one bag, but, if you don't want to be constantly crafting bags you can use a slime ball in an empty can to make it sticky so the bag never gets used.
- Garbage Trucks drop Suspicious Garbage Blocks.


But honestly, who would ever install this mod unironically?
